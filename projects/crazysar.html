    <h1>CrazySAR</h1>
    <p>
        CrazySAR is a modular aerial robotic system with decentralized control architecture built on the <a href="https://bitcraze.io" target="_blank">Crazyflie</a> platform. It consists of a collection of Crazyflie 2.1+ quadrotors connected to each other with fixed rods by spherical joints to create an open chain structure. The decentralized control architecture is modeled off of the Graph-Based Modeling and Control of Articulated Robots project, where each quadrotor is treated as an agent and physically connected agents can share state and control information. The rods are equipped with magents to allow for easy reconfiguration of the structure.

        The system demonstrates many of the benefits of a decentralized control architecture, even though it is a single articulated robot.

        One of the main advantages of decentralization is scalability. Control of the leader quadrotor (middle) can be chosen arbitrarily while the other quadrotors exert forces so as not to act against the constraint rods. Due to this, many quadrotors can be added to the structure without changing the control law.
